<h2>about this site</h2>
<p>This site is primarily a playground for me to learn and try out stuff. It is deployed in AWS and my goal is to be as much serverless as possible taking advantage of AWS Lambda and managed services like S3, DynamoBD, Route53, CloudFront, et cetera. Languages I will work with is primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS. I understand I will be forced to learn stuff like Maven and other tools too. </p>
<p>My personal programming experience as a professional was as an embedded developer working in Assembler and C, using small homebrewn realtime OS's, linking and building with make and deploying with EEPROM programming devices. Finally manually mounting the EEPROM on the physical device and then powering up keeping my fingers crossed no smoke would show up. Not kidding, stuff did catch fire due to bugs. This was in my view a much more simple approach to development. </p>
<p>Thus, there are some stuff to get used to with current technologies.</p>
<p>So, take it for what it is. I have no ambition with this site other than having fun and maybe being able to share one or two learnings with others.</p>
