<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I am a constantly curios and eager learner. An engineer by education and trade I have worked with both hardware, software and IT engineering in several different roles and on different levels of responsibility. My biggest professional strengths, I believe, are my ability to take a holistic view and that I am able to bridge the communication gap between different functions within and outside a company. On the private side I wish my strengths are that I am a present, stable and a calm (mostly) father, brother and husband. My interests are primarily working out, being outdoors and learning new stuff. </p>
